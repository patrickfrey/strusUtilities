<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
   The term "software" was first proposed by Alan Turing
   and used in this sense by John W. Tukey.
</p>
<h1>History</h1>
<p>
   An outline (algorithm) for what would have been the first piece of
   software was written by Ada Lovelace in the 19th century, for the
   planned Analytical Engine. However, neither the Analytical Engine
   nor any software for it were ever created.
</p>
<h1>Types of software</h1>
<p>
   On virtually all computer platforms, software can be grouped into a few
   broad categories.

     <ol><li>
       Application software.
     </li><li>System software includes:
          <ul><li>Operating systems
          </li><li>Device drivers.
          </li><li>Utilities.
          </li></ul>
     </li><li>Malicious software or malware.
     </li></ol>
</p>
<h1>Nature or domain of execution</h1>
<p>
     <ol><li>Desktop applications such as web browsers and Microsoft
       Office, as well as smartphone and tablet applications
       (called "apps").
     </li><li>JavaScript scripts are pieces of software traditionally
       embedded in web pages that are run directly inside the web
       browser when a web page is loaded without the need for a web
       browser plugin.
     </li><li>Server software, including Web applications, which usually
            run on the web server and output dynamically generated web pages
            to web browsers, using e.g. PHP, Java, ASP.NET, or
            even JavaScript that runs on the server.
     </li><li>Plugins and extensions are software that extends or modifies
       the functionality of another piece of software, and require that
       software be used in order to function;
     </li><li>Embedded software resides as firmware within embedded
       systems, devices dedicated to a single use or a few uses such as
       cars and televisions.
     </li><li>Microcode is a special, relatively obscure type of embedded
       software.
     </li></ol>
</p>
<h1>Programming tools</h1>
<p>
   Programming tools are also software in the form of programs or
   applications that software developers (also known as programmers,
   coders, hackers or software engineers) use to create, debug,
   maintain (i.e. improve or fix), or otherwise support
   software.
</p>
<h1>Architecture</h1>
<p>
   Users often see things differently from programmers. People who use
   modern general purpose computers usually see three layers
   of software performing a variety of tasks: platform, application, and
   user software.
     <ol><li>Platform software
     </li><li>Application software
     </li><li>User-written software
     </li></ol>
</p>
<h1>Execution</h1>
<p>
   Computer software has to be "loaded" into the computer's storage
   (such as the hard drive or memory). 
</p>
<h1>Quality and reliability</h1>
<p>
   Software quality is very important.
   Many bugs are discovered and eliminated (debugged) through
   software testing.
</p>
<h1>License</h1>
<p>
   The software's license gives the user the right to use the software in
   the licensed environment, and in the case of free software
   licenses, also grants other rights such as the right to make copies.

   Proprietary software can be divided into two types:
     <ol><li>freeware
     </li><li>software available for a fee
     </li></ol>
   Open source software, on the other hand, comes with a free
   software license, granting the recipient the rights to modify and
   redistribute the software.
</p>
<h1>Patents</h1>
<p>
   Software patents, like other types of patents, are theoretically
   supposed to give an inventor an exclusive, time-limited license for a
   detailed idea on how to implement a piece of
   software, or a component of a piece of software.
</p>
<h1>Design and implementation</h1>
<p>
   Design and implementation of software varies depending on the
   complexity of the software.
