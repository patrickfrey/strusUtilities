 Introduction
 The
NN user
VV interacts
 with
NN application
_ software
 on
 a
 typical
NN desktop computer
EE! .
 The
NN application software
_ layer
VV interfaces
 with
 the
NN operating
_ system
EE! .
 The
NN user
VV influences
 the
NN behaviour
 of
 the
NN system
 with
NN input
EE! .

 History
 An
NN algorithm
 for
 what
VV would
VV have
VV been
 the
 first
NN piece
 of
NN software
VV was
VV written
 by
NN Ada Lovelace
 in 
 the
 19th century
 ,
 for
 the
 planned
NN Analytical Engine
EE! .
 However
 ,
 neither
 the
NN Analytical Engine
 nor
 any
NN software
 for
 it
VV were
 ever
VV created

 Architecture

NN Users
 often
VV see
NN things
 differently
 from
NN programmers
EE! .
NN People
 who
VV use
 modern
 general purpose
NN computers
 (
 as 
VV opposed
 to
NN embedded systems
 ,
 analog
NN computers
 and
NN supercomputers
 )
 usually
 see
 three
NN layers
 of
NN software
VV performing
 a
NN variety
 of
NN tasks
 :
NN platform
 ,
NN application
 ,
 and
NN user
NN software
EE! .
