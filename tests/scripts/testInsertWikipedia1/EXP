His mother ,  Reine Citroën ,  was  from the  Dutch - Jewish family who founded  the  Citroën car company  in  France .  His father ,  Jules Ayer ,  was  a  Swiss Calvinist financier who worked  for the  Rothschild family . Ayer was educated  at  Ascham St Vincent 's  School , a  former boarding preparatory school  for  boys  in the  seaside town  of  Eastbourne  in  Sussex , in  which he started boarding  at the  comparatively early age  of  seven  for  reasons  to  do  with the  First World War , and  Eton College , a  boarding school  in  Eton (near  Windsor ) in  Berkshire .  It was  at  Eton  that  Ayer first became known  for  his characteristic bravado  and  precocity . Although  primarily interested  in  furthering his intellectual pursuits ,  he was very keen  on  sports ,  particularly rugby , and  reputedly played  the  Eton Wall Game very well .  In the  final examinations  at  Eton ,  Ayer came second  in  his year , and  first  in  classics . In  his final year , as a  member  of  Eton 's  senior council ,  he unsuccessfully campaigned  for the  abolition  of  corporal punishment  at the  school .  He won  a  classics scholarship  to  Christ Church, Oxford .  After  graduation  from  Oxford University Ayer spent  a  year  in  Vienna ,  returned  to  England  and  published his first book ,  Language ,  Truth  and  Logic  in  1936 . The  first exposition  in  English  of  Logical Positivism  as  newly developed  by the  Vienna Circle , this  made Ayer  at  age 26  the ' enfant terrible ' of  British philosophy . In the  Second World War he served  as an  officer  in the  Welsh Guards ,  chiefly  in  intelligence ( Special Operations Executive ( SOE ) and  MI6 ) .  Ayer was commissioned second lieutenant  into the  Welsh Guards  from  Officer Cadet Training Unit  on  21 September 1940 . After the  war he briefly returned  to  Oxford University where he became  a  fellow  and  Dean  of  Wadham College .  He thereafter taught philosophy  at  London University  from  1946  until  1959 ,  when he also started  to  appear  on  radio  and  television .  He was  an  extrovert  and  social mixer who liked dancing  and  attending  the  clubs  in  London  and  New York .  He was also obsessed  with  sport :  he had played rugby  for  Eton , and  was  a  noted cricketer  and a  keen supporter  of  Tottenham Hotspur football team . For an  academic ,  Ayer was  an  unusually well - connected figure  in  his time , with  close links  to ' high society ' and the  establishment .  Presiding  over  Oxford high - tables ,  he is often described  as  charming , but at  times he could also be intimidating . Ayer was married four times  to  three women . His first marriage was  from  1932–1941  to  ( Grace Isabel )  Renée ( d. 1980 ),  who subsequently married philosopher Stuart Hampshire ,  Ayer 's  friend  and  colleague . In  1960 he married Alberta Constance ( Dee )  Wells , with  whom he had one son .  Ayer 's  marriage  to  Wells was dissolved  in  1983  and that  same year he married Vanessa Salmon ,  former wife  of  politician Nigel Lawson .  She died  in  1985  and in  1989 he remarried Dee Wells ,  who survived him .  Ayer also had  a  daughter  with  Hollywood columnist Sheilah Graham Westbrook .  From  1959  to  his retirement  in  1978 ,  Sir Alfred held  the  Wykeham Chair ,  Professor  of  Logic  at  Oxford .  He was knighted  in  1970 .  Ayer died  on  27 June 1989 . From  1980  to  1989 ,  Ayer lived  at  51 York Street ,  Marylebone ,  where  a  memorial plaque was unveiled  on  19 November 1995 . cite book title A.J.

Unless  logical  or  empirical verification is possible ,  statements  like  God exists  or  charity is good are not true  or  untrue  but  meaningless , and  may thus be excluded  or  ignored .  Religious language  in  particular was unverifiable  and  as such literally nonsense .  He also criticises C. A. Mace 's  opinion  that  metaphysics is  a  form  of  intellectual poetry .  The  stance that  a  belief  in  God denotes  no  verifiable hypothesis is sometimes referred  to as  igtheism (for  example , by  Paul Kurtz ) .  In  later years Ayer reiterated  that  he did not believe  in  God  and  began  to  refer  to himself as an  atheist . He followed  in the  footsteps  of  Bertrand Russell  by  debating  with the  Jesuit scholar Frederick Copleston  on the  topic  of  religion .  Ayer 's  version  of  emotivism divides the  ordinary system  of  ethics  into  four classes :  # Propositions that express definitions of ethical terms, or judgements about the legitimacy or possibility of certain definitions # Propositions describing the phenomena of moral experience, and their causes # Exhortations to moral virtue # Actual ethical judgments He focuses  on  propositions  of the  first class — moral judgments — saying  that those of the  second class belong  to  science , those of the  third are mere commands , and those of the  fourth ( which are considered  in  normative ethics  as  opposed  to  meta - ethics )  are too concrete  for  ethical philosophy .  Ayer argues  that  moral judgments can not be translated  into  non - ethical ,  empirical terms  and  thus can not be verified ; in this  he agrees  with  ethical intuitionists . But  he differs  from  intuitionists  by  discarding appeals  to  intuition  of  non - empirical moral truths as worthless  since the  intuition  of  one person often contradicts  that of another .  Instead ,  Ayer concludes  that  ethical concepts are mere pseudo - concepts :  Between  1945  and  1947 ,  together  with  Russell  and  George Orwell ,  he contributed  a  series  of  articles  to  Polemic , a  short - lived British Magazine of  Philosophy ,  Psychology , and  Aesthetics edited  by the  ex - Communist Humphrey Slater . Ayer was closely associated  with the  British humanist  movement .  He was  an  Honorary Associate  of the  Rationalist Press Association  from  1947  until  his death .  He was elected  a  Foreign Honorary Member  of the  American Academy of Arts and Sciences  in  1963 .  In  1965 ,  he became  the  first president  of the  Agnostics '  Adoption Society  and in the  same year succeeded Julian Huxley  as  president  of the  British Humanist Association , a  post he held  until  1970 . In  1968 he edited The  Humanist Outlook , a  collection  of  essays  on the  meaning  of  humanism . In  addition he was one  of the  signers  of the  Humanist Manifesto . He taught  or  lectured several times  in the  United States ,  including serving  as a  visiting professor  at  Bard College  in the  fall  of  1987 . At a  party that same year held  by  fashion designer Fernando Sanchez ,  Ayer ,  then 77 ,  confronted Mike Tyson who was forcing  himself upon the  ( then )  little - known model Naomi Campbell .  When Ayer demanded  that  Tyson stop , the  boxer said :  Do  you  know who  the  fuck  I  am ? I 'm  the  heavyweight champion  of the  world ,  to  which Ayer replied :  And I  am  the  former Wykeham Professor  of  Logic . We  are  both  pre - eminent  in our  field . I  suggest  that we  talk  about this like  rational men .  Ayer  and  Tyson then began  to  talk , while  Naomi Campbell slipped out .

Of the  experience ,  Ayer first said  that  it slightly weakened  my  conviction  that my  genuine death ...  will be  the  end  of me , though I  continue  to  hope  that  it will be . However , a  few days later he revised  this ,  saying what  I  should have said is  that my  experiences have weakened ,  not  my  belief  that  there is  no  life  after  death , but my  inflexible attitude  towards that  belief . In  2001 Dr Jeremy George , the  attending physician ,  claimed  that  Ayer had confided  to  him :  I  saw  a  Divine Being . I 'm afraid  I 'm going  to  have  to  revise all  my  books  and  opinions . Ayer 's  son Nick ,  however ,  said  that  he had never mentioned  this to  him  though  he did find his father 's  words  to  be extraordinary , and  said he had long felt there was something possibly suspect  about  his father 's  version  of  his near death experience . cite web last Ayer first A.

The  principle was  at the  time  at the  heart  of the  debates  of the  so - called Vienna Circle which Ayer visited  as a  young guest .  Others ,  including  the  leading light  of the  circle ,  Moritz Schlick ,  were already offering their own papers  on the  issue . Ayer 's  own formulation was  that a  sentence can only be meaningful  if  it has verifiable empirical import ,  otherwise it is  either  analytical  if  tautologous , or  metaphysical ( i.e.  meaningless , or  literally senseless ) .  He started  to  work  on the  book  at the  age  of  23  and  it was published when he was 26 .  Ayer 's  philosophical ideas were deeply influenced  by those of the  Vienna Circle  and  David Hume .  His clear ,  vibrant  and  polemical exposition  of them  makes Language ,  Truth  and  Logic essential reading  on the  tenets  of  logical empiricism–  the  book is regarded  as a  classic  of  20th century analytic philosophy , and  is widely read  in  philosophy courses  around the  world . In  it ,  Ayer also proposed  that the  distinction  between a  conscious man  and an  unconscious machine resolves  itself into a  distinction  between ' different types  of  perceptible behaviour ' ,  an  argument which anticipates  the  Turing test published  in  1950  to  test  a  machine 's  capability  to  demonstrate intelligence .  Ayer wrote two books  on the  philosopher Bertrand Russell ,  Russell  and  Moore :  The Analytic Heritage ( 1971 ) and  Russell ( 1972 ) .  He also wrote  an  introductory book  on the  philosophy  of  David Hume  and a  short biography  of  Voltaire .  Ayer was  a  strong critic  of the  German philosopher Martin Heidegger . As a  logical positivist Ayer was  in  conflict  with  Heidegger 's  proposed vast ,  overarching theories regarding existence . These  he felt were completely unverifiable  through  empirical demonstration  and  logical analysis . This  sort  of  philosophy was  an  unfortunate strain  in  modern thought .  He considered Heidegger  to  be  the  worst example  of  such philosophy ,  which Ayer believed  to  be entirely useless .  In  1972–1973 Ayer gave  the  Gifford Lectures  at  University of St Andrews ,  later published  as  The  Central Questions  of  Philosophy . In the  preface  to the  book ,  he defends his selection  to  hold  the  lectureship  on the  basis that Lord Gifford wished  to  promote natural theology , in the  widest sense  of that  term ' , and that  non - believers are allowed  to  give  the  lectures  if  they are able reverent men ,  true thinkers ,  sincere lovers  of and  earnest inquirers  after  truth . He still believed  in the  viewpoint he shared  with the  logical positivists : that  large parts  of  what was traditionally called philosophy– including  the  whole  of  metaphysics ,  theology  and  aesthetics– were not matters that could be judged  as  being true  or  false  and that  it was thus meaningless  to  discuss  them .  In  The  Concept  of a  Person  and  Other Essays ( 1963 ),  Ayer heavily criticized Wittgenstein 's  private language argument .  Ayer 's  sense - data theory  in  Foundations  of  Empirical Knowledge was famously criticised  by  fellow Oxonian J. L. Austin  in  Sense and Sensibilia , a  landmark 1950s work  of  common language philosophy .  Ayer responded  to this in the  essay Has Austin Refuted  the  Sense - data Theory ? ,  which can be found  in  his Metaphysics  and  Common Sense ( 1969 ) . page ix,  Language ,  Truth and Logic ,  Penguin , 2001 page 140,  Language ,  Truth and Logic ,  Penguin , 2001 The Central Questions of Philosophy , p. ix cite journal last Schlick first Moritz url title Unanswerable Questions publisher The Philosopher volume XIII year 1935 accessdate 4 November 2011 Awards He was awarded  a  Knighthood  as  Knight Bachelor  in the  London Gazette  on  1 January 1970 .
